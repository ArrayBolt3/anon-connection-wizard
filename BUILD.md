# Building Anon Connection Wizard

Start by getting the source code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/irykoon/anon-connection-wizard.git
cd anon-connection-wizard
```

## Linux

Install the needed dependencies:

For Debian-like distros: `apt install -y python3-yaml python3-pyqt5 python3-stem python3 tor obfs4proxy`
