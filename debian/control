Description: First Time Connection Setup
 When the gateway starts for the first time, it won't automatically connect to 
 the public Tor network. This is useful for users who want to hide Tor from
 their ISP. anon-connection-wizard is automatically started, which let the 
 user choose  from  different methods to connect (public Tor network,
 bridges, etc.).
 The wizard can be run at any time to change the connection configuration.
