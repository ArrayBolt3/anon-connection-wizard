Description: Tor Connection Configuration (ACW)
 WARNING: Not (yet) a standalone ready to use outside of Whonix:
 .
  * Non-Whonix (users different distributions): Does not modify Tor
    configuration file `/etc/tor/torrc`. Therefore not effective by itself.
    Useful for developers.
  * Whonix: Fully functional in Whonix thanks to default pre-insatlled package
 `  anon-gw-anonymizer-config` which configured all requirements for ACW.
 .
 Creates a Tor settings file:
 .
  * Non-Whonix (users different distributions):
    `/etc/torrc.d/40_tor_control_panel.conf`
  * Whonix:
    `/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/40_tor_control_panel.conf`
 .
 anon-connection-wizard (ACW) is a Tor-launcher-like application that helps
 users in different Internet environment connect to the Tor network.
 It helps user to configure Tor to use a proxy and/or Tor bridges.
 This application is especially useful for system Tor users who would like
 to run the standalone core Tor with different torified applications.
 The wizard can be run at any time to change the connection configuration.
