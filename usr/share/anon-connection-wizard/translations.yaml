        enable_tor:
            I am ready to enable Tor.

            I use proxy or firewall settings to connect to the internet.

        something_wrong:
            <p>Something is wrong with torrc!</p>
            <p>Press "Next" and try and fix the problem as per the instructions, or as a last resort,
            report a bug.</p>

        no_torrc:
            <p>The file "/etc/tor/torrc" does not exist.</p>
            <p>You can try to manually create /etc/tor/torrc. Open it&#58;
            <blockquote>Start Menu -> Applications -> System -> Torrc</blockquote>
            And add.
            <blockquote>#DisableNetwork 0</blockquote>
            Save. Then re-run Whonix Setup.</p>

        bad_torrc:
            <p>The line "DisableNetwork 0" does not exist in "/etc/tor/torrc".</p>
            <p>You can try to manually edit /etc/tor/torrc&#58;
            <blockquote>Start Menu -> Applications -> System -> Torrc</blockquote>
            <p>Add line containing only "DisableNetwork 0" (without the quotes),
            and re-run Whonix Setup.</p>

        cannot_connect:
            <p>"sudo service tor@default status" returned non-zero exit code , which means Tor does NOT work.</p>
            <p>Maybe your Whonix-Gateway has only one network card attached? Most likely there
            is something wrong with your /etc/tor/torrc.</p>
            <p>You can try to manually edit /etc/tor/torrc&#58; </p>
            <blockquote>Start Menu -> Applications -> System -> Torrc</blockquote>
            <p>Running&#58; </p>
            <blockquote>sudo service tor@default restart</blockquote>
            <p>might help with troubleshooting.</p>

        tooltip_1:
            <p>This option lets you connect to the public Tor network now.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>By default, Tor does not try to hide the fact that you are using it. If this concerns you, read
            the instructions from the  option "Tor is censored or dangerous in my area" and select it.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, the best protection is a social approach. The more Tor users there are near you and the more
            diverse their interests, the safer it will be to use it. Convince other people to use Tor!</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Note. anon-connection-wizard enables Tor networking by uncommenting "DisableNetwork 0" in /etc/tor/torrc.

        tooltip_2:
            <p>This option will disable Tor networking.</p>
            <p>It should be used in case you want to make sure Tor will not connect to the public Tor network.</p>

        tooltip_3:
            <p><b>The bridges option is not available yet. You must configure Tor manually.</b></p>
            <p>Less sophisticated censors prevent users from accessing the Tor network by blocking connections to known relays.
            "Bridge relays" help these users access Tor by not being in the same public lists as normal relays.
            Sophisticated censors can only be circumvented with private obfuscated bridges.
            Because there is NOT a 100%  way to hide Tor, Whonix does NOT recommend using Tor if you fear detection.</p>

            <p><i><b>Configure Whonix to Use a Bridge.</b></i><br></br>
            You must manually find and add the bridges to /etc/tor/torrc.<br></br>
            <blockquote>Start Menu -> Applications -> System -> Torrc</blockquote>
            <p>After you have finished, run anon-connection-wizard again.</p>
            <p>More detailed instructions on how to add bridges can be found in /etc/tor/torrc.example file's Bridges section.</p>
            <blockquote>Start Menu -> Applications -> System -> Torrc.example</blockquote>

            <p><i><b>Configure Whonix to Use a VPN.</b></i><br></br>
            Where Tor is censored but VPNs are allowed, you can hide your Tor connection inside a VPN connection.
            To the censors, your internet traffic will look like an encrypted VPN connection. The VPN will then send your
            Tor traffic onward to the first Tor relay.</p>
            <p>If you are using Whonix-Gateway inside a virtual machine, configure your VPN software on the host operating system.
            Your VPN provider will have instructions for you to follow and possibly custom software to help you connect.</p>
            <p>However, you MUST configure your VPN software (whether custom or built into your operating system) to send
            all internet traffic through the VPN connection, and you MUST configure your VPN software to block all internet
            traffic if the VPN is suddenly disconnected. Additionally, you MUST NOT chose PPTP as your encryption even if
            your VPN allows it. Improperly configured VPN software will reveal your Tor connection to the censors.</p>
            <p>Whonix recommends a VPN provider who is serious about privacy and is outside the reach of your censors.</p>


        tooltip_4:
            <p>You must manually edit /etc/tor/torrc for Tor to navigate through your firewall or proxy.</p>
            Or, if you are using a graphical Whonix-Gateway&#58; </p>
            <blockquote>Start Menu -> Applications -> System -> Torrc</blockquote>
            <p>After you have finished editing, run anon-connection-wizard again.</p>
